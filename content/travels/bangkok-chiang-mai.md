John and Rita dropped us off at Cranbrook airport on December 12.  It was a nice morning but there had been some snow. We'd left early so we could take our time on the drive and went for coffee together before leaving. Our flight this time was [Cranbrook-Vancouver-Tokyo-Bangkok](http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=YXC-YVR-HND-BKK). I had arranged to meet my sister Jayne at the airport.  We were supposed to have 2 hours in Vancouver but it was pouring when we arrived and took over 30 minutes to get a gate and get off the plane. We did get to spend a quick half hour with Jayne before we headed through customs.

#### BKK December 14-16

The flights were uneventful, which is always good! There was a long stopover in Tokyo, we were in Haneda not Narita so we didn’t bother to leave the airport. We arrived in Bangkok quite early, but being old hands took the train to our hotel, the [Vie Bangkok](https://g.page/viehotelbangkok?share). They arranged to check us in early, so we enjoyed a nice breakfast before settling in for a snooze. 

We slept, went to the malls, ate great Thai food around the corner at [Grandmothers](https://goo.gl/maps/2zp46goEeNjNBc487) and found a place to watch the LFC game. We sat at the bar with some other supporters, one of the quieter footie evenings! We ended up taking the wrong train on one of our trips, but we were able to rectify that quickly. After a nice couple of days, we headed back to the airport to go to Chiang Mai. 

#### Chiang Mai December 16- January 11

We had booked an airbnb in an area that we were familiar with so it was easy to walk places and go out. Our first night, still a bit jet lagged, we headed off to see God and Yves at their bar. It was about a 20 minutes to get to the new MelloMango bar but it was great to be there. Interestingly it was in an area that we had been before, near the old night market and not far from Top North where we stayed in 2000. It was great to see everyone! We spent a lot of time here!

The next night it was off to Small House Cafe to see Dao. It was a short little walk and we had a nice visit. We had a nice surprise in Chiang Mai when we received a message from Yann. In May 2017, we had met Yann in Myanmar and hung out with him, Pat and Liz for a month. Yann had seen Paul’s post that we were in Thailand and asked where we were. He was taking vacation and had just arrived in Bangkok but flew up the next day. It worked out well because he was able to stay in the same building.

For Christmas Eve, God and Yves put on a huge meal and invited everyone to come and spend time with them. God’s family, his Mom, sister and nephews were all there. It was a great meal with all sorts of different foods and we had a wonderful time. Ness was in town, so we were able to see him and got to meet Ian. Bo was also there as he had moved up from Bangkok. It was a great way to spend Christmas and we had a fantastic evening.

We spent the next week having great breakfasts of either khao soi or brunch, followed by a nice coffee. We found several places that were very close… Khao Soi Maesai, Le Brunch and House 33. We split time evenings between Small House and MelloMango.

For New Years the plan was MelloMango, then Small House and then to a house party we were invited to. As often happens we didn’t make it out of MelloMango until quite late so headed back to sleep. It was another great night and we enjoyed seeing all the lanterns.

We spent the next week going for breakfast, coffee and Khao Soi, walking around to malls or bars. Even went out for a fancy meal and drink on one rainy evening! Yann went up to Chiang Dao for a while, we had talked about going but decided to stay in Chiang Mai. I had my usual hair cut at NewYork NewYork while Paul went to the barber. On a whim I decided it was time and cut an undercut done. I was very nervous so the first day didn’t take off too much… I went back the next day for more. 

God, Ness and Ian took us to a local fair one night. God’s Mom and sister were there so we got to see them and hang out for a bit before we wandered around. There were rides, booths, snake charmers, contests and food, so much food. It was a lot of fun and we had a good time. They started a quiz night at MelloMango so we took our Sofaking selves out to participate while we were there. It was great fun but we lost on an art round the first night and performance was lacking in our next session since we were leaving in a day or two.

It was great to be able to spend time with everyone and we were sad to say goodbye. We had planned to possibly head back for Songkrahn in April. With that, we took off to Vietnam.
